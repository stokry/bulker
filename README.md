Face recognition script that will automatically delete all images inside of a folder from a given image.

Imagine that we have thousands of images inside of a folder and we want to delete all images where a particular person appears.  That process can take hours or even days, and that's where this script comes in.  You can tell this program what to delete and the program will find all images associated with that person and delete them.
